```java
// Java code for linearly searching x in arr[].

import java.io.*;

class GFG {
    public static int search(int arr[], int N, int x)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == x)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    // Driver code
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 };
        int x = 10;

        // Function call
        int result = search(arr, arr.length, x);
        if (result == -1)
            System.out.print(
                "Element is not present in array");
        else
            System.out.print("Element is present at index "
                             + result);
    }
}

```

**Definition**: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions or a step-by-step process designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem.

**Characteristics**: For a set of instructions to be considered an algorithm, it should possess the following characteristics:

- Definiteness: Each step of the algorithm is clear and unambiguous.
- Finiteness: The algorithm completes after a finite number of steps.
- Input: Accepts zero or more inputs.
- Output: Produces at least one output.
- Effectiveness: Each operation must be basic enough to be performed exactly within a finite time.

**One problem - Many Solutions**: An algorithm becomes essential when there is more than one possible solution for the same problem. The goal of algorithm design is often to find the most efficient solution, prompting the question: **Can we do better?**

- evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms
- compare them (trade-off)

### **2. Introduction to Time Complexity and Big O Notation (10 Minutes)**

#### **Complexity Definition**

- Time Factor: Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in the sorting algorithm.
- Space Factor: Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm to run/execute.

#### **Why Analyze Algorithms?**

When designing algorithms, we need to understand how well they perform, especially in terms of efficiency. This is often evaluated by analyzing two main cases: (explain from linear search example)

- Worst-case analysis: Assesses the maximum time an algorithm could take. It‚Äôs the most common analysis type because it provides a guarantee of performance.
- Average-case analysis: Estimates the time taken on average, which requires domain-specific knowledge and is sometimes less predictable.

The primary focus in algorithm analysis is often on worst-case performance. This is because it ensures that the algorithm will perform within a certain limit, regardless of the input.

#### **Big O Notation**

Big O notation describes an upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm. If an algorithm has time complexity $ T(n) $, we say $ T(n) = O(f(n)) $ if there exists a constant $ c $ such that:

$$ T(n) \leq c \times f(n) \quad \text{for large enough } n $$

For example:

- If $ T(n) = 4n^2 + \log_2(n) + n $, we find the highest order term (in this case, $n^2$), so $T(n) = O(n^2)$.

In algorithm design, we frequently focus on the "rank" or order of growth of an algorithm, rather than the exact number of operations. This approach is known as asymptotic analysis.

Why Big O Notation?

- **Simplification**: It's much simpler for algorithms to focus on high-level design.
- **High-level focus**: Constants vary based on architecture, compiler, and programmer.
- **Scalability**: It becomes crucial when dealing with large inputs.

For example, if two algorithms both process large inputs but one scales quadratically while the other scales linearly, the linear one will generally perform better on larger inputs, despite specific constant factors.

### **3. Hands-On Exercises (10-15 Minutes): Time Complexity Analysis**

Each exercise below includes pseudocode, followed by questions to analyze time complexity.

#### **Exercise 1: Counting Elements in a List**

          for element2 in arr2:
              if element1 == element2:
                  return True

              if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                  return True
      return False
  ```

          if element == target:
              return True
      return False
  ```

- **Binary Search (Assumes Sorted List)**:

  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while left <= right:
          mid = (left + right) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return True
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              left = mid + 1
          else:
              right = mid - 1
      return False
  ```

              for k in range(n):
