## **Session Outline**

### **1. Introduction to Backtracking (15 minutes)**

#### **Backtracking Definition**

Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end. It is commonly used in situations where multiple possibilities need to be explored to solve a problem, such as solving puzzles like Sudoku.

Backtracking uses recursion to explore possibilities by breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and systematically trying out different choices.

#### **Algorithm Template:**

```java
void FIND_SOLUTIONS(parameters):
    if (valid solution):
        store the solution
        return
    for (all choices):
        if (valid choice):
            APPLY(choice)
            FIND_SOLUTIONS(parameters)
            BACKTRACK(remove choice)
    return
```

#### **Problem Categories in Backtracking:**

1. **Decision Problems**: Finding a feasible solution (e.g., Does a solution exist?).
2. **Optimization Problems**: Finding the best solution (e.g., What is the optimal solution?).
3. **Enumeration Problems**: Generating all feasible solutions (e.g., How many solutions exist?).

#### **Time Complexity:**

Let's say there are n steps (decisions to make), and at each step, you have k choices.

To find the total number of possible combinations, you multiply the choices at each step:

Total Possibilities = k \* k \* k \* ... (n times) = $k^n$

Exponential Growth: The time complexity of backtracking is typically $O(k^n)$ because you have to explore all possible combinations of choices.

### **2. Backtracking vs. Dynamic Programming (15 minutes)**

**Dynamic Programming (DP)** solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant computations.

- **Top-Down Approach (Memorization):** Solves the problem recursively and stores results in a memorization table to avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times.

- **Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation):** Starts with solving the smallest subproblems first and uses their results to iteratively build up solutions for larger subproblems.

### When to Choose Backtracking vs Dynamic Programming

- **Backtracking** is ideal when the problem requires exploring all possible solutions (e.g., decision or enumeration problems) and doesn't have overlapping subproblems (when solving subproblems separately doesnâ€™t necessarily help solve the larger problem optimally).
- **Dynamic Programming** is more efficient for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, such as optimization problems (e.g., shortest path, LIS).

**Example Analogy:**
Think of backtracking as exploring a maze where you systematically try every path and backtrack if you hit a dead end. Dynamic programming, on the other hand, is like using a map of the maze to avoid revisiting the same sections unnecessarily, thus saving time and effort. Solves smaller subproblems first and combines their results.

**Comparison Table:**

| Property     | Backtracking               | Dynamic Programming                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Nature       | Recursive, tries all paths | Recursive/Iterative, avoids recomputation |
| Memory Usage | Stack frames (recursion)   | Array/table (memoization/tabulation)      |
| Efficiency   | Exponential (worst-case)   | Polynomial (if overlapping subproblems)   |
| Example      | N-Queens, Sudoku           | Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)      |

### **3. Exercises (50 minutes)**

#### **Exercise 1: Generate n-bit Gray Codes (Backtracking)**

**Problem:** Generate all possible n-bit Gray Codes using backtracking.

**Link**: [Generate n-bit Gray Codes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-approach-generate-n-bit-gray-codes/)

**Explanation**:

- **Exploration**: The function tries adding both `"0"` and `"1"` to build all possible combinations.
- **Undoing (Backtracking)**: After exploring one path (e.g., adding `"0"`), the function **backtracks** (returns) and explores the other path (adding `"1"`).

1. **Base Case**:
   - If `n` is `0`, print the result and stop the recursion.
2. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function makes two recursive calls:

   - One call adds `"0"` to the current result.

   - Another call adds `"1"` to the current result.

- **Code Implementation:**

```java
void generateGrayCode(int n, String result) {
    if (n == 0) {
        System.out.println(result);
        return;
    }
    generateGrayCode(n - 1, result + "0");
    generateGrayCode(n - 1, result + "1");
}
```

#### **Exercise 2: Solve Sudoku Using Backtracking**

**Problem:** Solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

**Link**: [Solve Sudoku](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sudoku-backtracking-7/)

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursive Exploration:**
   - It moves cell by cell across the board.
   - If a cell is empty (`'?'`), it tries every number from `'1'` to `'9'`.
2. **Validation and Backtracking:**
   - For each number, it places the number and recursively attempts to solve the rest of the board.
   - If a solution is not found, it resets (backtracks) and tries the next number.
3. **Base Case:**
   - When it reaches the end of a row (`j == 9`), it moves to the next row.
   - When it reaches the end of the board (`i == 9`), it checks if the board is valid and prints it if so.

**Code Implementation:**

```java
public class Main
{
    void solveSudoku(char[][] board, int i, int j) {
        if (j == 9) {
            solveSudoku(board, i+1, 0);
            return;
        }
        if (i == 9) {
            if (check(board))
                printBoard(board);
            return;
        }
        if (board[i][j] != '?') {
            solveSudoku(board, i, j+1);
            return;
        }
        for (char k = '1'; k <= '9'; k++) {
            board[i][j] = k;
            solveSudoku(board, i, j+1);
        }
        board[i][j] = '?';
    }

    static boolean check(char[][] board) {
        // Create arrays to check rows, columns, and subgrids
        boolean[][] rows = new boolean[9][9];
        boolean[][] cols = new boolean[9][9];
        boolean[][][] subgrids = new boolean[3][3][9];

        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] != '?') {
                    int num = board[i][j] - '1'; // convert char to index (0-8)

                    // Check the row
                    if (rows[i][num]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    rows[i][num] = true;

                    // Check the column
                    if (cols[j][num]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    cols[j][num] = true;

                    // Check the subgrid
                    int subgridRow = i / 3;
                    int subgridCol = j / 3;
                    if (subgrids[subgridRow][subgridCol][num]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    subgrids[subgridRow][subgridCol][num] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    static void printBoard(char[][] board) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                System.out.print(board[i][j] + " ");
                if (j%3 == 2)
                    System.out.print("  ");
            }
            System.out.println();
            if (i%3 == 2)
                System.out.println();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[][] board = {
            {'?', '3', '4', '6', '7', '8', '9', '1', '2'},
            {'6', '7', '2', '1', '9', '5', '3', '4', '8'},
            {'1', '9', '8', '3', '4', '2', '5', '6', '7'},
            {'8', '5', '9', '7', '6', '1', '4', '2', '3'},
            {'4', '2', '6', '8', '5', '3', '7', '9', '1'},
            {'7', '1', '3', '9', '2', '4', '8', '5', '6'},
            {'9', '6', '1', '5', '3', '7', '2', '8', '4'},
            {'2', '8', '7', '4', '1', '9', '6', '3', '5'},
            {'3', '4', '5', '2', '8', '6', '1', '7', '9'}
        };
        solveSudoku(board, 0, 0);
    }
}
```

#### **Exercise 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**

Solve the **Longest Increasing Subsequence** problem in three different ways:

**1. Backtracking Approach:**

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Case**:
   - When `i` reaches the end of the array (`i == arr.length`), it returns 0, signifying no more elements to consider.

2. **Exclude the Current Element**:
   - `exclude` stores the result of recursively calling `backtrackLIS` by moving to the next element (`i+1`) without including the current element `arr[i]`.

3. **Include the Current Element**:
   - `include` stores the result of recursively calling `backtrackLIS` by moving to the next element (`i+1`) and including the current element `arr[i]` if it is greater or equal to the previous element `arr[j]`. This adds 1 to the result, indicating inclusion.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - The function returns the maximum of `include` and `exclude`, ensuring all paths are explored and the longest subsequence is found.

**Code Implementation:**

```java
int backtrackLIS(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
    if (i == arr.length) return 0;
    int exclude = backtrackLIS(arr, i+1, j);
    int include = 0;
    if (arr[i] >= arr[j]) {
        include = backtrackLIS(arr, i+1, i) + 1;
    }
    return Math.max(include, exclude);
}
```

**2. Top-Down DP (Memoization):**

Optimizes backtracking by storing and reusing results of subproblems, reducing redundant work and improving efficiency.

**Explanation:**

- **Memoization Table**:
  - Uses a table `dp` to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. initialized to `-1`.
- **Memoized Results**:
  - If the result for `(i, j)` is already computed (`dp[i][j] != -1`), it returns the stored value.
- **Update Memoization Table**:
  - Stores the result of `Math.max(include, exclude)` in `dp[i][j]` to use later.

**Code Implementation:**

```java
int topDownLIS(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
    if (dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];
    if (i == arr.length) return 0;
    int exclude = topDownLIS(arr, i+1, j);
    int include = 0;
    if (arr[i] >= arr[j]) {
        include = topDownLIS(arr, i+1, i) + 1;
    }
    dp[i][j] = Math.max(include, exclude);
    return dp[i][j];
}
```

**3. Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation):**

Builds the solution from the ground up by solving smaller subproblems and combining their solutions to solve larger subproblems.

See this video to understand the solution: [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE2b_-XfVDk)

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `dp` array where each element starts as 1, representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element.

2. **Iterate Through Elements**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` (starting from the second element), look back at all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`).
   - If `arr[i] > arr[j]`, it means `arr[i]` can extend the subsequence ending at `arr[j]`.

3. **Update DP Array**:
   - For each valid pair (`arr[i] > arr[j]`), update `dp[i]` to be `Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. This accounts for including `arr[j]` in the subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.

4. **Find Maximum Length**:
   - After filling the `dp` array, traverse it to find the maximum value, which represents the length of the LIS.

**Code Implementation:**

```java
int bottomUpLIS(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int[] dp = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(dp, 1);

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    int maxLength = 0;
    for (int val : dp) 
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, val);
    return maxLength;
}
```

This method ensures an optimal solution with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, where `n` is the length of the array.
